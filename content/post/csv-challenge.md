I created this little experiment to find out about the tools and the workflow of other developers.

For the challenge I just paraphrased a little task I had to do for my daily job
and asked other developers to solve the problem their own way.

The engagement was way higher than I expected and together we created a really nice overview about all sorts of tools and programming languages.
