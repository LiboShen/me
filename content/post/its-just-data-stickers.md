I designed stickers. Find me at a conference some day or get in touch if you like them!

They are transparent and die cut.

Even better, you can download the Illustrator files and print your own:

Feel free to share them, modify them or do anything you like.

The *.ai* files are actually templates that can be directly used to order from Sticker Mule.

The *"Value of Values"* talk by Rich Hickey nicely illustrates the bigger picture for this line of thinking:
