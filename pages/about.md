I'm an engineer turned founder.

Love the craft of making software.

Founded [JsutRecap](https://justrecap.it), a tool helps you learn better and faster from videos.

Before that, worked in companies as big as Google and as small as a 5-person startup.

You find to me on [Twitter](https://x.com/liboshen), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/libo-shen), and [Github](https://github.com/LiboShen).
