Even if lines of code is not an accurate representation of the complexity of a project, it can still be an interesting number to get a feeling for the size of a software project. To ignore files not tracked by Git (like node\_modules) you can use the following command to see how many lines a git project has:

```
git ls-files | xargs cloc
```

Just make sure you have [cloc][cloc] installed.
