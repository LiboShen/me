Sometimes `grep` can be the fastest tool to find something.

If you're already on the command line, `grep` is there.

With `grep 'text' files` you can search for some text in certain files.

Using [wild cards](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=unix+wild+cards&t=canonical) can be really flexible to select the right files.

As soon as you found the right files and you want to edit them now, you can pass the `-l` flag to `grep`. This just `l`ists the files instead of showing the matching line.

Now, you can pass this list of files to your editor:

```
grep -l 'remember' */appinfo/info.xml | xargs vim
```

Even if it takes some time to learn the commands, a shell can be really helpful for daily tasks.

It gives you a lot of flexibility and opportunities to automate things.
