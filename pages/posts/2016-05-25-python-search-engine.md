I wrote a little search engine in Python. The source is over [here](https://github.com/jorinvo/r/blob/master/search.py).

This is only to demonstrate how the basic concepts behind search engines work.

All processing is done in-memory and the algorithms are optimized for readability - no thoughts about performance.

The implementation shows:

- How to crawl and parse websites
- How to create an index
- A way to calculate a primitive [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank)
- How to calculate the [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) between a query and a document
- And finally, how to combine them to output ranked search results

You can try the script with your own web page and search for some terms.

If you learn best by playing around with code instead of reading about the theory, feel free to try out this module in the Python interpreter and see what all the different functions do.


Here is an example using my own website at time of writing:

(Note that the crawler doesn't follow external links)

```
$ python search.py 'ruby go' https://jorin.me
crawled https://jorin.me with 21 links
crawled https://jorin.me/index.xml with 0 links
crawled https://jorin.me/https-for-one-month with 2 links
