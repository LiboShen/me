What am I good at?

I definitely know how to brush my teeth!  Or do I?  How long does it take to master brushing your teeth?

Let's assume 4 Minutes of brushing a day (which is already quite long!):

```
         10.000 hours to master a skill
* 60  = 600.000 in minutes
/ 4   = 150.000 days to master brushing your teeth
/ 365 =     411 in years
```

Way to go to become a real master!
