This is a graphic novel about the so-called "foundational quest" in mathematics. You may have heard the result of the quest: the third crises in mathematics. Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Kurt GÃ¶del, Alan Turing. These figures usually show up in my textbooks. It's funny to "see" them in a comic book. However, I'm a little disappointed when I realized it didn't try to explain the math problem the characters were facing. Comics could be a good media to explain the deep thoughts from that golden time to the mass. It's a missed chance.
