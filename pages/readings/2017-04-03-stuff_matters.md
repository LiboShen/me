Given how much materials shape our lives and cultures, itâ€™s surprising how little we think about them. One of the strengths of this book is that it tells stories very well. Unlike many other popular science books using anecdotes of the scientists centuries ago to keep the book "fun", this book uses the author's own experiences which every modern person can empathize.
