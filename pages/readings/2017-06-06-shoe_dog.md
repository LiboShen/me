"Find your calling." This is probably the most repeated sentence in this book. The legend of starting a shoe company might just be yet another success story for us. But finding the calling and working hard on it are really the essence. The book is so engaging that I could not stop listening (yes, I listened to the audio book) when I hit the last few chapters. I ended up extending my walk nearby my home at 11 pm, just to listen through the book to the end.
