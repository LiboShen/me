I read the official biography of Steve Jobs a few years ago when it just came out. I didn't know much about Jobs before that book, and that book gave me a slightly negative view on him. This book instead, empathized the period after Jobs left Apple. So in a developer's analogy, you can think of the relationship between these two Steve Job books above as "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide" vs "JavaScript: The Good Parts". In this sense, this book is more worth reading for most people. Personally speaking, some parts of the book are deeply touching.
