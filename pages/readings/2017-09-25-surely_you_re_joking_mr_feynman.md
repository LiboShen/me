This title is indeed the best reflection of the narrative of the whole book. Feynman is amusingly intelligent. It might be the privilege of people with great achievement that Feynman sometimes admits lucks and the tricks which resulted in people thinking he was even smarter. But I like it. Mr. Feynman felt more real to me when I read these details. The tone of the book is very cheerful. It almost makes me think Feynman got an unfair share of luck in his life. But, I also know the story, from somewhere I cannot remember now, of his first wife's death. It's a sad story. What surprises me most is that both of them are very calm after they know the inevitable fate. I tend to believe, inside the jokingly amusing appearance, Feynman must also have an intense spirit. But who knows.
