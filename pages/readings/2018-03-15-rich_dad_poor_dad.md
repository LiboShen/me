I'm not feeling great to admit I read this book at this age. The book was quite popular in China when I was a kid. Now after reading it I understand why it was popular in China at that time and why the author is controversial in the west. This book is basically a chant of Capitalism. It's useful for people realizing they need to embrace Capitalism to some degree.

By the way, together with this book I also read a book originally written in German, called "小狗钱钱" (Money for a Puppy). It's about the same idea, but in a different tone. It's like someone telling me: "Look, Capitalism isn't that bad. Money is not evil." Because it is supposed to be a children's book, I cannot find any cover picture that suits this list. Therefore I'll skip it.
