The book should just be called "The Software Developer's life manual". It's not really about soft skills in the common context. Anyway, this is still a book worth reading, if you are the targeted audience. The book is easy to read and extremely practical. Sometimes I felt I was reading a collection of high-quality blog posts rather than a thick book. (It's a compliment in this context.)
