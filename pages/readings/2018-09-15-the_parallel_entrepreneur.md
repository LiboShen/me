This is a practical and encouraging book. I started to do some of my side projects more seriously because of this book. However, I'm still in the typical fallacy for developers: doing far less marketing than should. Ironically, I was warned by the book beforehand. The book consists of two parts: theory and practice. I can imagine the second part could get out-dated pretty soon given the fast-pace evolution in tooling.
