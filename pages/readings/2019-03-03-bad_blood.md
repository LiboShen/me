A business thriller covers the rise and fall of Theranos, a biotech unicorn in Silicon Valley. The news report written by the author back in 2015 first unveiled the fraud of Theranos. The book first tells the story how Theranos got so successful (money, fame, endorsement from credible figures). Then it details the challenges the author encountered when trying to investigate after getting tips from different sources. The conflicts between a west coast biotech unicorn and a WSJ journalist are eye-opening for me. I was so engaged when I hit the second half of the book I can hardly stop.
