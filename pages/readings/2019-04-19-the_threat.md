I expected to know details about how the FBI works before I started reading this book. But it seems to only scratch the surface. It's cool to know FBI agents are trained to use a different way to unbuckle the seat belt than normal people. But it's not enough for me. The latter sections of the book mainly talked about the political stuff around Trump's election and administration. Maybe because I lacked the proper politics context (after all, I never lived in the US), it felt to me that the author spent a half of the book responding to an allegation about his wife made by the Trump election campaign team years ago.
