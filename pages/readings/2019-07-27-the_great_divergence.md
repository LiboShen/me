I read this book partially as an experiment to see how much I can absorb by reading it in a short time. I skipped paragraphs aggressive but made notes about the main points. It ended up quite well. I think for a research oriented book like this one, this approach works for me. The book itself is quite like the more famous "Guns, Germs, and Steel". The hypotheses they provide are eye-opening for me. But as a non-researcher, sometimes I feel they are too evidence-heavy. (Because as a non-researcher, extra evidence doesn't really help persuading me further, because I don't know whether there are counter-evidences.)
