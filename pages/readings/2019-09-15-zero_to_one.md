Maybe due to the high expectation, this book isn't that impressive to me. Or maybe because I just read it too fast. The book is very easy to read. It uses many examples in today's tech world which I'm already familiar with. However, I don't have any first-hand experience on running any business. That might be the reason I cannot fully appreciate it as well. I think I'll read it again someday, and my opinion may change.
