This book provides comprehensive view, backed data, about how our daily life choices would impact global climate change. In short, lifestyle matters. It's important to inform everyone what the environmental price of their everyday activities is. However, as a technophile who has hope on technologies solving our problems, I found this book a little depressing when it gave lifestyle suggestions to its readers. In my opinion, it's helpful to alarm some people, but we cannot rely on everybody finely controlling their desire to save the world. Systematic problems need systematic solutions.
