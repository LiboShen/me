When the news of Snowden leaking the PRISM program came out, I didn't pay enough attention. I thought it was just another political drama. Later I watched the documentary about him "Citizenfour" and realized this is actually a serious issue. In this book, Snowden told his life story, and explained why he did what he did.
Besides PRISM scandal, Snowden's experience before it is also intriguing: grew up as a tech-savvy kid in a government official family, enlisted in special force candidate, got technical job for CIA without a college degree, lived in Geneva with diplomatic cover, and designed a global disaster-tolerant storage system. Even despite the climax of PRISM, just these stories alone are still wild for me.
One minor thing I donâ€™t like about this book is, it spent too many pages talking about the author's childhood in the beginning. Things are like being amazed and getting interested in new technology as a kid. Compared with the rest of the book, this part is way too slow paced.
In summary, as a technologist, I respect Snowden, and I recommend this book.
