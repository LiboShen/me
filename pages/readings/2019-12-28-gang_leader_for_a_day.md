This book recounts the author's firsthand observation of a gang in Chicago and the residents living in the gong area. It's interesting to know these people's lives, because I know so little of them. One takeaway I got from this book is, regardless of being poor or rich, in-law or out-law, the power dynamic among people share some same patterns. A drug-dealing gangster may use the similar tricks, in spirit, as corporates when dealing with management. There is probably something wired in our minds about this.
