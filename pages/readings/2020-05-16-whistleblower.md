The author was known to me because of the news coverage of her blog post about Uber two years ago. I decided to read this book because I heard she was a homeschooler before college which is uncommon in the tech world.

The first quarter of the book is about her childhood and the homeschooling experience, which is interesting to me. Her family was relatively poor, but both her parents are very upbeat people. I felt deeply sorry when I knew her father passed away early.

However, when reading about the incident in her time in Upenn, I felt the author weaseled. The book apparently didn't tell the whole story. The same feeling got confirmed again and again when I read the rest. Also the narrative in the latter half of the book is repetitive. It feels like there were not many new thoughts to fill the book.

I believe the fact that she was treated poorly. But I just don't like someone trying to paint a perfect image for themselves. Writing a worth-reading memoir takes a huge amount of self-reflection. We shouldn't rush it before the mind is ready.

I admire her courage and intelligence, as she described in this book. But, honestly, this book doesn't feel genuine to me.
