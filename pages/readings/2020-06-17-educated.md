This is a memoir of Tara Westover, who grew up in a religious survivalist family, poorly homeschooled until her 17, but eventually finished Phd in Cambridge with scholarship. It was recommended by my friend after my disappointment of the book Whistleblower.

Rather than the impressive achievement of finding the path from a junkyard to Trinity College, the book is actually about her struggle when facing the conflict between her family belief and the more civilized outside world.

The author was candid. There were many of her stories in the book that I'll feel too embarrassed to tell if I was her. I really appreciate it that the author chose to write her journey with such a high fidelity.
