This book is about the OKR method. I knew OKR before, but by reading this book, my understanding is reformed. Iâ€™m convinced that goal setting is an important skill worth practicing from early on.
About a half of the chapters of the book are real-world success stories narrated by the person who adopted OKR. They are fun to read, however, they (especially the ones from Google) are oversimplified. Sometimes I learn more anecdotes rather than OKR from them.
Another minor problem of this book is, it spends too many pages to explain what instead of how. Maybe because it needs to explain to and persuade readers with different backgrounds.
In summary, if you are short on time, skipping the history and selectively reading the non-story chapter would be fine for the first time reading. After more goal-setting experience is equipped, the stories might show more value.
