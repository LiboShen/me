This book is about how to refine and polish your ideas to make them "sticky". In the nutshell, it's about how to communicate effectively at scale. We are living in a world increasingly influenced by intangible ideas, rather than mere physical materials. To make a change, first plant your ideas, like a seed, in peopleâ€™s minds. This book provided a framework to make ideas more sticky to people's minds. The book is both inspiring and practical.
A minor drawback of this book, personally speaking, is that it uses a lot of psychology experiments to support the arguments (like many business books). To me, they are not really adding credibility, just extra stories. (Because, you know, the replicability issues.)
In summary, this is a book worth spending time to read and take notes. Maybe someday I would share my notes as a mindmap.
