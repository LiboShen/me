This is a biograph of Paul Dirac, a theoretical physicist played an important role of founding the Quantum Mechanics, and won his Nobel Prize at age 31.
"The strangest man" was a comment to Dirac by Niels Bohr. But Bohr was by no means a mean person. To give an oversimplified description of Dirac's social interactions, to some degree he is like a autistic person (a.k.a "rain man").

The strangeness of Dirac has another fold: his insistent emphasize on mathematical beauty over experimental results when assessing physic theories. This contrasted with many his peers at that time, but may be a less controversial opinion today.

Dirac's stories happened in an era which is full of wars, ideological polarization, and scientific breakthroughs.

The drama in the background started from the so-called Black-body radiation problem in physics and climaxed at, you bet, the making of nuclear weapons.

Dirac happened to have connections to all the main players on the centre of the stage. He and many his friends were, at some moment at some capacity, involved in the research programs of nuclear weapons for each their own countries, which were often on the opposite sides in a hot or cold war.

Although, as mentioned above, this book contains enough elements to make the a blockbuster movie, sometimes it's not that entertaining to read. After all it's a biography not a novel. I guess one must be first total amazed by Dirac's work intellectually to fully appreciate the all the life details about Dirac in the this book. From what I heard, it can be "easily" achieved by reading Dirac's book "The Principles of Quantum Mechanics" :)
